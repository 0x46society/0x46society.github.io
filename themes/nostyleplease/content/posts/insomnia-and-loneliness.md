I've tried everything to fall asleep. Magnesium, breathing exercises, sleeping gummies, ashwagandha, even fever meds. Nothing works. My brain won't shut the fuck up, racing through thoughts I can't even remember because they're so cluttered and chaotic. I focus on my breathing, imagine peaceful places, count backwards from 100. I tire myself out at the gym. None of it changes anything. I barely sleep, then drag myself to the office. Rinse and repeat.

The worst part? I don't have a solid reason to feel like this. I have everything and more. A good job, financially stable, a comfortable place, can eat anything I want, both a bike and a car, a good computer—everything a single man could hope for. I should be grateful. I should be happy. But I'm not.

The one thing I don't have is someone to talk to. It's embarrassing to admit. I could just go out there and meet people, but I don't. I stay in the comfort of my place, avoid conversations, grind my career. I've convinced myself that I don't need anybody. That I need to grind and be the best—that's all that matters. Other people are just distractions. I don't need them, they need me. I'm a lone wolf.

Except I'm not. Deep down, I wish I had a shoulder to lean on. A person I could share my feelings with. Someone there during my ups and downs. I had some people like that once, but I kept pushing them away. I regret it. I feel bad about it. I've tried to make things better with some of them, but obviously, it's hard to be accepted again. I don't blame them—if I were in their place, I'd do the same exact thing.

I always have this contemplation about opening up again, but if I do, I'm opening myself up to get hurt again. I've given multiple chances before, and every single time I just kept getting hurt. Love is scary and painful. I know there's someone out there who might fit me, but I don't know when I'll meet them. Or maybe I already did and missed my chance? I don't know.

I'm tired. I hope things get better. But right now, all I know is I'm tired of being tired.
