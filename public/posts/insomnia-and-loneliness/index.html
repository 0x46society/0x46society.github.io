    <h1>Can&#39;t Sleep, Can&#39;t Connect</h1>

    

    <p>I&rsquo;ve tried everything to fall asleep. Magnesium, breathing exercises, sleeping gummies, ashwagandha, even fever meds. Nothing works. My brain won&rsquo;t shut the fuck up, racing through thoughts I can&rsquo;t even remember because they&rsquo;re so cluttered and chaotic. I focus on my breathing, imagine peaceful places, count backwards from 100. I tire myself out at the gym. None of it changes anything. I barely sleep, then drag myself to the office. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>The worst part? I don&rsquo;t have a solid reason to feel like this. I have everything and more. A good job, financially stable, a comfortable place, can eat anything I want, both a bike and a car, a good computer—everything a single man could hope for. I should be grateful. I should be happy. But I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>The one thing I don&rsquo;t have is someone to talk to. It&rsquo;s embarrassing to admit. I could just go out there and meet people, but I don&rsquo;t. I stay in the comfort of my place, avoid conversations, grind my career. I&rsquo;ve convinced myself that I don&rsquo;t need anybody. That I need to grind and be the best—that&rsquo;s all that matters. Other people are just distractions. I don&rsquo;t need them, they need me. I&rsquo;m a lone wolf.</p>
<p>Except I&rsquo;m not. Deep down, I wish I had a shoulder to lean on. A person I could share my feelings with. Someone there during my ups and downs. I had some people like that once, but I kept pushing them away. I regret it. I feel bad about it. I&rsquo;ve tried to make things better with some of them, but obviously, it&rsquo;s hard to be accepted again. I don&rsquo;t blame them—if I were in their place, I&rsquo;d do the same exact thing.</p>
<p>I always have this contemplation about opening up again, but if I do, I&rsquo;m opening myself up to get hurt again. I&rsquo;ve given multiple chances before, and every single time I just kept getting hurt. Love is scary and painful. I know there&rsquo;s someone out there who might fit me, but I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll meet them. Or maybe I already did and missed my chance? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired. I hope things get better. But right now, all I know is I&rsquo;m tired of being tired.</p>
